            <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt + 1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 shallot, diced</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>8 oz sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups orzo</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2/3 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 ball burrata cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees.</li>
            <li>Make the chicken rub. Mix together the dried rosemary and garlic powder into a small bowl. Add olive oil.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Brush both sides with the rub mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat a dutch oven over medium high heat. Add butter and a splash of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Sear chicken until golden brown. Flip and brown the other side. The chicken should be mostly cooked, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and set aside on a dish. Cover the dish with tin foil. Drain some of the excess fat from the dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the sun dried tomatoes. Save 1 tbsp of oil from the jar.</li>
            <li>Add the sun dried tomato oil to the pan. When it's hot, add the onion and shallot and saute until transluscent.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and the garlic, saute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the orzo and stir to evenly coat it.</li>
            <li>Add the white wine to deglaze the pan. Reduce the white wine while scraping the bottom of the pan for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock and stir.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken back to the pot and push it down until the liquid covers it.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until orzo is cooked and chicken temperature reaches 165 degrees.</li>
            <li>Add both cheeses and put the pan into the oven uncovered. Cook until cheese is melted. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
